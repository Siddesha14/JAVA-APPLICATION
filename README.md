# Calorie Tracker App

## Overview
The **Calorie Tracker App** is a desktop application developed in Java using Swing, designed to help users track their daily calorie intake and set calorie goals. The app allows users to input their personal information (height, weight, age, and activity level) to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and recommend a daily calorie intake. It also enables users to log their calories consumed and track progress toward their calorie goals.

- **Data Persistence**: Stores data such as total calories consumed and calorie goal in text files.
